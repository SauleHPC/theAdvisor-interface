1. reorg files in:
  -raw upload
  -compute matching
  -upload matching
  -construct theadvisor
  -back end

3. think about best place to index
  - what does that mean?

5. API documentation
  -hell yes!
  -also testing!

6. using citeseer data for citation

8. in backend, decide what to do on "not found"
  - Probably should move to a proper "result" object

9. In javascript code, redo the range loop with for (const v of col)

10. Enabling file to encode matchings that AREN'T true
  - probably should be used when theadvisor papers get created to make it safer

11. optimize making theadvisor papers
  - In particular, reducing making individual queries; for instance in citer/citee build logic

12. string matching code should really be able to take existing matches to skip entries we have already matched.
  - there is some logic in theres quite strange.

13. improve matchign code.
  - currently matchign code is ONLY using title to string match.
  - when there are many great matches, we probably should look for other attribute for matching (for instance year)
